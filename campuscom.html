		<h1>Campus Compatibility</h1>
		<center><img src="http://www.indnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/COLLEGE_CampusCompatibility_Header.jpg"></center>
		</div>
		<div>
		<h2>With more than 3,000 colleges and universities across the country, there's at least one campus that's just right for you.</h2>
		<p>Spend some time imagining the kind of college experience you want and need. To simplify your search, consider the ways in which your finances, career goals and personality can help you narrow down what type of school you will want to tour.</p>
		<h3>The Hometown Hero:</h3>
		<h4>Consider a community college or regional university if:</h4>
		<p>You want to save money: By commuting to class, a student can cut thousands of dollars in annual college housing fees. Living nearby spares you from hefty traveling expenses that come with flying or driving long distances to come home for holidays.</p>
		<p>You get homesick easily: College is a big step and for some, a familiar home environment is a necessity during this transition. By continuing to live at home or close to home, you can get an education while still seeing family and friends. </p>
		<p>You are unsure of what you want to study: Attending classes on a local campus enables you to hone in on what areas of study you enjoy without having to pack up your life and start over in a new town. Many community colleges offer the same classes, allowing students to transfer credits and enroll at another campus.</p>

		<h3>The Big Fish in a Small Pond:</h3>
		<h4>Consider a small school if: </h4>
		<p>You value the importance of community: Most small colleges have a strong sense of community. In many ways, making connections on a small campus is easier to do, since students typically see each other on a regular basis.</p>
		<p>You like small classes: At a small school, you have better chances of getting to know all of your professors well. If you are a hands-on type of learner that benefits from one-on-one time with teachers, you may want to look into attending a university with a smaller student-to-professor ratio.</p>
		<p>You're looking for leadership: Breaking into leadership roles in campus activities might be easier on a small campus. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div>	
		<h3>The Stand Out in a Crowd:</h3>
		<h4>Consider a big school if:</h4>
		<p>You are ready for a challenge: After four years attending high school and seeing the same people every single day, the idea of going to a big school can be really refreshing. Also, if you like learning in large groups and working hard to stand out to your professors, you could thrive at a big school.</p>
		<p>You hope to meet people from different cultures: Large universities attract more students from other states and even other parts of the world. At a big college, it is not uncommon to have classes with students whose first languages are not English, and a diverse student body will be reflected in the variety of organizations and activities on campus.</p>
		<p>You want access to more course offerings: Large universities have the faculty and the physical space to offer more majors, minors and concentrations. This means you can explore a broad range of subjects and fun electives.</p>
