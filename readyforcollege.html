		<h2>Get Involved </h2>
		<p>Getting ready for college isn't all work. Find something you really like doing, then dive into it. Maybe you're drawn to sports, student council, music, art ... you get the picture. You'll develop skills and be more appealing to colleges (they like students who'll add something to campus life).</p>
		<h2>Do the Work</h2>
		<p>If you expect to go to college later, expect to study now. No one can do it for you. Don't talk the college talk - "I'll go to college to get a great career"- without walking the walk.</p>
		<h2>Take Challenging Courses</h2>
		<p>Colleges look at your grades, sure, but also at how difficult your courses are. They want to see that you've challenged yourself. Plus, if you pursue advanced courses, such as AP, you may be able to get college credit.</p>
		<h2>Get Help</h2>
		<p>Having trouble in a class? Many schools have peer tutors, students in upper grades who'll help you (for free). Talk to teachers or counselors-let them know you want extra help.</p>
		<h2>Read</h2>
		<p>Read at least 30 minutes every day, beyond study and homework. Read what interests you-magazines, novels, whatever. People who read more know more. And when you take PSAT/NMSQT, ACT, and SAT tests, knowing more will really pay off.</p>
		<h2>Don't Delay</h2>
		<p>You take the PSAT/NMSQT or ACT as a junior (or even as a sophomore). So you have a few semesters before then to take the solid math and other courses that get you ready.</p>
		<h2>Get the College-Bound Facts</h2>
		<p>How do you know all the right moves to get into college? Ask someone who's done it. Get to know your counselors. Ask a career planner at a local college, or a trusted teacher. Do Web research.</p>
